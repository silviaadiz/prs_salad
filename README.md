# PRS salad info

Hi!
You are in the repo for the third chapter of my PhD thesis. It's called "PRS salad" because I run a mix of polygenic score analyses. Although I kind of structured the scripts into folders, I created the repo just to store them somewhere, so there is not a logical order. Also, if you happen to find a mistake within any of the scripts, please let me know at silviadiz03@gmail.com

- [Lettuce](#baselettuce)
   - [compute_metrics_prs.R](#script-1)
    - [fit_logistic_mods_prs.R](#script-2)
    - [lasso_model_bootstrap.R](#script-3)
- [Chicken](#Chicken)
   - [forestplot_prs.R](#forestplot)
- [Toppings](#Toppings)
    - [ld_clumping.R](#ld_clumping)
    - [metrics_fst.R](#metrics_fst)
    - [prs_CT_auto.R](#prs_CT_auto)



## Lettuce <a name="baselettuce"></a>
These scripts are the ones related to model fitting and model validations with bootstrap.
